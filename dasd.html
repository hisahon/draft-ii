  abstract = {On 10 May 2024, a powerful coronal mass ejection arrived at Earth at 17:05UT and caused a major geomagnetic storm. With the minimum SYM-H excursion of −497 nT (5-min data), this storm is the largest geomagnetic disturbance since March 1989, and can be categorized as a superstorm. In this work, by using ground-based and space-borne instruments, we focus on unusual aspects of the electrodynamic and ionospheric response to the May 2024 storm at middle and low latitudes. Between the storm onset at 17:05UT, and until ∼19:40UT, we observed signatures of strong unshielded prompt penetration electric fields (PPEF), which caused an increase of the equatorial ExB drifts up to 95 m/s. This led to the occurrence of a strong ionospheric super-fountain effect. The local pre-noon sector was the first to respond to the PPEF, with a very rapid increase of the ionization and the EIA development in the local morning sector. Whereas, in the afternoon-evening sector the ionosphere responded with ∼2 hr of delay, and the response continued to intensify even after the equatorial ExB drifts had dropped to undisturbed values. The development of such a powerful super-fountain effect without or with little electrodynamic forcing is difficult to explain, but it could be due to storm-time meridional and zonal thermospheric winds. During the early recovery phase of the storm, a second positive ionospheric storm occurred over the Australian-West Pacific region in the local late afternoon to pre-midnight sector, driven by another ionospheric uplift associated with the occurrence of smaller-amplitude equatorial upward ExB drifts.},

  abstract = {Large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LSTIDs) are wave-like structures propagating through the ionosphere from auroral to lower latitudes, affecting radar-based technologies and satellite navigation. Due to their disruptive effects, timely detection is crucial. This work presents an autonomous detection technique based on travel-time diagrams of detrended Total Electron Content (TEC). Our method employs a network of GNSS receivers across Europe, selected using a K-Means clustering algorithm to ensure comprehensive spatial coverage. Applying image processing techniques, we identify propagating features of positive and negative amplitude in detrended TEC keograms. These features are fitted using the RANdom SAmple Consensus method to estimate propagation speed along the North-South direction. Following feature identification, we refine our results by merging positive and negative perturbations and filtering out false positives based on physical constraints. This methodology allowed us to compile a catalog of LSTID with periods ranging from 30 to 90 min, spanning 2021–2024. To validate our approach, we conducted case studies and statistical analyses, confirming accuracy and reliability. Additionally, testing in North America and Japan demonstrated the algorithm broader applicability. Our findings, obtained with user-defined parameters tailored to examine LSTIDs with periodicities in the 30–90 min range, show an average speed of 629 ± 215 m/s and period of 62 ± 14 min. A direct relation with auroral electrojet indices confirms that stronger auroral currents produce faster, higher amplitude and shorter period LSTIDs. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a link between LSTID occurrences and geomagnetic activity, reinforcing previous findings.},

  abstract = {Deep convective clouds and lightning activity during thunderstorms imprint Infrasonic ( \{ {$>$} \textbackslash 3 mili Hertz) oscillations in the ionospheric density or Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs). The wave characteristics of these oscillations and the coupling mechanisms remain a subject of investigation, noting that the coupling energetics may alter the spectral and propagation characteristics. Moreover, the availability of numerous convective dynamics time scales makes the oscillation detection time uncertain. To study these aspects, the present work examines the spatial-temporal lightning flash rate during a severe thunderstorm (cloud top temperature \{{$<$} \textbackslash −80°C) from the GOES16 infrared channel and the total electron content of the ionosphere from the GNSS network over the tropical Southern Hemisphere. The study finds TIDs amplification above the deep convective clouds. The strongest amplification occurs at the earliest, at 9 min, from the most intense lightning flash rate and propagates at the most probable speed of 400–1,100 m/s. In contrast to the spectral peak of the active storm, which is 1.2 mHz, the spectral peak of TIDs is 4.8 mHz. The results highlight the magnitude of coupling energetics to determine the wave propagation characteristics of infrasonic TIDs.},

  abstract = {The ionosphere is characterized by a large number of disturbances generated in response to a wide range of phenomena, including natural hazards, space weather and man-made events. Identification of the origin of ionospheric disturbances (ID), especially in real or near-real-time (NRT), is an extremely difficult task, and it is one of the most interesting fundamental scientific questions. In this paper we present, for the first time, an approach for an automatic and NRT-compatible detection and recognition of the source of ionospheric disturbances in time series of total electron content (TEC) measured by the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) method. The main idea is (a) to analyze main characteristics (such as spatio-temporal features and frequency content) of ID generated by known sources, and (b) in NRT, to rapidly examine ID's features, and, based on this information, recognize their source. Currently, our database contains TEC data series with response to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, explosions, rocket launches, equatorial plasma bubbles and geomagnetic storms. Our developments are important for the future assessment of natural hazards from the ionosphere, and also for NRT Space Weather nowcast and applications. Also, our work presents important information about the physical properties of ID of different origins.},

  abstract = {In this work, we used multiple ground-based and space-borne instruments, and we studied the ionospheric, thermospheric, magnetic and electrodynamic responses to the annular eclipse of 14 October 2023, that affected both North and South America. Based on the vertical total electron content (VTEC) maps and Swarm data sets, we observed a strong eclipse impact on the ionosphere with a 40\% TEC depletion recorded at midlatitudes, likely induced by the lack of photoionization. At low-latitudes, we observed a more complex response with only 20\%–30\% decrease in the VTEC and an overall weakening of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). Our observations suggest that the equatorial and low-latitude effects result from a combination of a significant decrease in the equatorial electrojet (EEJ), magnetic field intensity (mainly the X component) and vertical ion velocity as observed by ground-based magnetic data and the JULIA radar. Besides, the eclipse also strongly impacted the thermosphere and caused a 10\%–30\% drop in the neutral mass density and a 25\%–30\% change in the O/N2 ratio in the vicinity of the eclipse path. The observed disturbances suggest the presence of thermospheric winds converging toward the umbra region. Such winds can induce significant additional effects on the EIA electrodynamics, which we consider to be a major factor of the complex equatorial and low-latitude response.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies demonstrated a huge potential for ionospheric total electron content (TEC) measurements to be included in earthquake and tsunami risk assessments. However, up to now, only a few methodologies or tools can be used in near-real-time (NRT) for these purposes. For the first time, this study presents a method allowing for fast simulations of Co-Seismic Ionospheric Disturbances (CSID) or ionoquakes. The new analytical simulation code models the propagation of acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) generated by a co-seismic uplift of the ground/seafloor, by resolving the governing equations in the time-altitude-horizontal domain. The method models the near-field CSID in about 60 s of simulation time, that is, before the waves are detected in the ionospheric TEC measurements. The developed method is, therefore, among the first most promising products in Ionospheric Seismology that can be used for NRT applications, such as tsunami early warning.},
