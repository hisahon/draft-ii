                <p>
                    The Project IONO-DIET aims to develop, for the first time, ionosphere-based methods that will detect earthquakes and tsunamis 
                    in near-real-time (NRT), and will determine the earthquake source parameters and/or tsunami wave-heights from the ionosphere 
                    in NRT. The latter will be done based on detection of co-seismic and co-tsunamic ionospheric disturbances by GNSS receivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ambition of IONO-DIET is to contribute in the improvement of the existing warning systems by rapidly providing the missing 
                    piece of information about the seismic source and the tsunami-genesis of an earthquake, or the estimates of the wave heights of 
                    tsunamis propagating in open sea.

            <!-- IONOSPHERE -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Ionosphere</h2>
                <p>
                    The ionosphere is a part of the atmosphere that extends from 60–80 to 800–1000 km of altitude, where the concentration of charged 
                    particles (i.e., free electrons and ions) is enhanced. The total mass of the ionosphere is 10**12 – 10**13 times smaller than the 
                    mass of the neutral atmosphere. However, despite being “minor” in terms of particle concentration, the ionosphere is particularly 
                    important with regard to radio signal propagation and radio communications in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1950, the ionosphere was formally defined by the Institute of Radio Engineers committee as "the part of the Earth's upper 
                    atmosphere where ions and electrons are present in quantities sufficient to affect the propagation of radio waves." The ionosphere 
                    and its state depend on solar activity, diurnal (the day/night) and seasonal conditions, latitude, altitude, the coupling with the 
                    geomagnetic field and with the neutral upper atmosphere (thermosphere).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ionosphere is primarily formed by solar radiation. Solar UV, X-ray and shorter wavelengths of solar radiation are ionising, as 
                    photons at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge electrons from a neutral gas atom/molecule upon absorption. 
                    The reverse process to ionisation is recombination, in which a free electron is "captured" by a positive ion. Recombination occurs 
                    spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination. As gas density increases at 
                    lower altitudes, the recombination process prevails, since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The balance between these 
                    two processes determines the quantity of ionisation of the atmosphere.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Impulsive forcing from the Earth's surface occurring due to earthquakes, explosions, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and so forth 
                    triggers atmospheric pressure waves. Depending on their frequencies, these atmospheric waves can be distinguished as acoustic and 
                    gravity waves (Figure 2). The acoustic waves are characterized by frequencies higher than the acoustic cutoff frequency (ωa), that is, 
                    higher than ~3.3 mHz. The acoustic waves are longitudinal waves in which particle moves in the direction of the wave propagation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The force restoring a displaced particle toward its original position is the change of pressure associated with the compression of the 
                    medium (Hargreaves, 1992). Therefore, acoustic waves traveling through a gas disturb the equilibrium state by compressions and 
                    rarefactions (Zel'dovich &amp; Raizer, 2002). The acoustic waves propagate at the speed of sound that is equal to ~330 m/s at the surface 
                    and grows up to 800–1,000 m/s at the ionospheric altitude of 250–300 km. Therefore, it only takes ~8–9 min for the acoustic waves to 
                    reach the ionosphere.

                        “the acoustic cutoff frequency” indicating that acoustic waves with ω &gt; ωa propagate through the atmosphere. The frequency ωb is 
                        the Brunt-Väissälä frequency (or buoyancy frequency). Waves with frequencies below the ωb are the gravity waves. In the lower atmosphere, 
                        the acoustic cutoff frequency is typically 3.3 mHz, and ωb is 2.9 mHz.

                <p>
                    The propagation and evolution of the acoustic and gravity waves in the atmosphere is greatly affected by the propagation medium and its 
                    properties. The exponential decrease of the atmospheric density with the altitude leads to the growth of both acoustic and gravity waves 
                    upon their upward propagation. The wave's amplitude is proportional to the atmospheric density; however, in accordance with the energy 
                    conservation law, the amplitude of the acoustic and gravity waves increases in order to maintain constant energy flux (Hines, 1960). 
                    The resulting amplification factor reaches 10^4 at ~150 km of altitude (lower atmosphere) and 10^5–10^6 at 350–400 km (upper atmosphere 
                    and ionosphere) (Blanc et al., 2010; Lognonné et al., 2006).

            <section class="section">
                <h2>GNSS for Ionospheric Sounding</h2>
                <p>
                    GNSS offer a powerful and accessible tool allowing the monitoring of the ionosphere. Due to the dispersive nature of the ionosphere, 
                    signals from dual-frequency GNSS receivers make it possible to measure the total electron content (TEC)—the electron density integrated 
                    along the raypath from a satellite to a receiver (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2008).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowing the positions of GNSS satellites and those of ground-based GNSS-receivers, one can estimate the coordinates of TEC perturbations. 
                    Assuming that the ionosphere is a thin shell layer located at the altitude Hion (Figure 3), the intersection point between the Hion and 
                    line-of-sight (LOS) between a satellite and a receiver is called ionospheric piercing point (IPP). The IPP projection onto the Earth's 
                    surface is called a subionospheric point (SIP). These IPP and SIP allow tracking ionospheric TEC perturbations observed by the GNSS-method.
